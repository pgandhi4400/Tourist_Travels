                    <p class="andhra_para">Located on the banks of River Yamuna in Uttar Pradesh, Agra is a popular tourist destination as it is home to one of the 7 wonders of the world, the Taj Mahal. It is a sneak peek into the architectural history and legacy of the Mughal empire with two other UNESCO World Heritage Sites Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri. History, architecture, romance all together create the magic of Agra, and hence, makes for a must-visit for anyone living in or visiting India.</p>

                    <p class="andhra_para">One of the oldest cities on the banks of Yamuna, Vrindavan is considered to be one of the most important places of pilgrimage for the devotees of Krishna. It is said that Lord Krishna had spent his childhood in Vrindavan. The name of the city has been derived from Vrinda (meaning basil) and van (meaning grove) which perhaps refer to the two small groves at Nidhivan and Seva Kunj. Since Vrindavan is considered to be a sacred place, a large number of people come here to abandon their worldly life.</p>

                    <p class="andhra_para">Sela Pass is a mountain pass which enjoys an elevation of 13,700 feet. Snow covers this pass all year round and it remains open for the tourists during all seasons. This pass is considered sacred by Buddhists, and it is believed that there are 101 lakes around it. 

                        The fame of the pass is also attributed to the divine high altitude Sela Lake or often known as the Paradise Lake that adds grace to the picturesqueness of the place. Sela Lake freezes during the winter which makes this lake dreamlike. </p>
