Snow covers this pass all year round and it remains open for the tourists during all seasons. This pass is considered sacred by Buddhists, and it is believed that there are 101 lakes around it. 

                        The fame of the pass is also attributed to the divine high altitude Sela Lake or often known as the Paradise Lake that adds grace to the picturesqueness of the place. Sela Lake freezes during the winter which makes this lake dreamlike. </p>
