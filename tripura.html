                    <p class="andhra_para">Agartala is not just all flowers and valleys but also has a cultural richness with the diversity of people that stay here along with the historical and religious monuments. The capital of Tripura manages to create its culture and personality out of the coming together of stories of all those who reside here and give it a hue of their own culture. The most developed city in the state, it is still a far cry from the metros and hence maintains the best of both worlds.</p>

                    <p class="andhra_para">Unakoti is where India's heritage stores its carvings and sculptures of gods and goddesses. For such a storehouse of religious and spiritual importance, it is only justified that the place also be the house to lush green flora and full of natural beauty. Many of the rock carvings here depict the life of Lord Shiva as well as other instances from the Hindu Mythology. Sculptures of the Nandi Bull, Lord Ram , Lord Ganesha , Lord Hanuman and Lord Ganpati can also be seen here Unakoti also makes a good place for hiking, trekking and other activities given the terrain and the natural offerings of the area.</p>
