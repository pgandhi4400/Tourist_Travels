The bountiful and pristine Jogidhara river is the reason behind the birth of this mesmerizing and bubbling waterfall. The water meanders through hills and verdant trees producing ear pleasing sounds. The reservoir that forms at the bottom of the waterfall is perfect to take a dip in. The cool water will rejuvenate your soul and body.</p>
