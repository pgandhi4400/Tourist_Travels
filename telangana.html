                    <p class="andhra_para">A city of contrasts, Hyderabad exudes an old-world charm of its own with the Old City (Charminar side), Hitech City (Cyberabad) and the other areas lying between the old and the new. The capital and the largest city of Telanaga, Hyderabad is home to stately mosques and noisy bazaars lined parallelly alongside swanky new office buildings and malls, and it is these very contrasts – these glimpses into the city’s rich past with inherent promises of an even better future –that make Hyderabad a city worth visiting. Maybe even more than once.</p>

Papikondalu is a sheer fest to the eyes in terms of its scenic beauty. As the hills become closer and closer to the visitor, the width of the mighty Godavari becomes narrower. </p>

                    <p class="andhra_para">The Warangal city is credited as the fifth largest city in this state. The legends have it that it was known as Oruguallu or Omtikonda or Ekasilanagaram mainly due to the existence of a huge hillock which seemed to have been carved out entirely off one stone. Warangal takes you back to the era of kings and queens with its beautiful historical sites. Warangal natural beauty is no less impressive and the Parkhal Lake and wildlife sanctuaries are also definitely worth checking out. Warangal also houses a National Institute of Technology(NIT) which has made it a famous student hub today.
