                    <p class="andhra_para">The gateway to the northeast and the largest and most cosmopolitan city in the region, Guwahati serves as the starting block for the other seven sisters locations . This featureless city – a prosaic heap of glass and concrete for the most part – is a blend of old and new sights but there are a scattering of interesting temples to explore, when it comes to tourist places in Guwahati. Walk its back alleys and old quarters to  click some timeless picture and you will be able to salvage a generous amount of local flavour that lingers amid its suburban sprawl of ponds, palm trees, small single-storey traditional houses and old colonial-era mansions.It is located on the south bank of the river Brahmaputra and is the largest city of Assam and Northeast.</p>
